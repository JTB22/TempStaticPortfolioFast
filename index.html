        👋 Hello world! I'm Joshua Blood, an aspiring software engineer who is
        just starting my journey into computer programming. I'm excited to code
        my way to new career opportunities! I'm currently enrolled in the
        BloomTech 👨‍💻 Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, where I'm leveling up
        my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js and more. When I'm not debugging
        code, you can find me doing katas and learning new techniques to improve
        my skills. My background is in 🛠 manufacturing, operations, and mechanic
        work on cars and small engines, but I'm ready to make the switch to
        tech! I love solving problems and creating efficient systems. My goal is
        to eventually work on products that make people's lives easier. I'm a
        quick learner who thrives in fast-paced environments. Outside of work, I
        enjoy spending time with my family 👪, being outdoors 🏕️, and watching
        YouTube videos (mostly programming 💻). I'd love to connect with other
        developers, so please reach out! I'm excited to see where this coding
        journey takes me. 😄
